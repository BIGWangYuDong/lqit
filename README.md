## Introduction

LQIT is an open source Low-Quality Image Toolbox, including low-quality (underwater, foggy, low-light, etc.) image enhancement tasks,
and related high-level computer vision tasks (such as object detection). LQIT depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [OpenMMLab 2.0 series](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.
The compatibility to earlier versions of PyTorch is not fully tested.

## Installation & Dataset Preparation

LQIT depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), and [MMEval](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmeval).
It also can use [OpenMMLab codebases](https://github.com/open-mmlab) as a dependency, such as [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master).

Please refer to [Installation](docs/en/get_started.md) for installation of LQIT and [data preparation](data/README.md) for dataset preparation.
