# TIENet: Task-oriented Image Enhancement Network for degraded object detection

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Abstract

Degraded images often suffer from low contrast, color deviations, and blurring details, which significantly affect the performance of detectors. Many previous works have attempted to obtain high-quality images based on human perception using image enhancement algorithms. However, these enhancement algorithms usually suppress the performance of degraded object detection. In this paper, we propose a taskoriented image enhancement network (TIENet) to directly improve degraded object detection’s performance by enhancing the degraded images. Unlike common human perception-based image-to-image methods, TIENet is a zero-reference enhancement network, which obtains a detectionfavorable structure image that is added to the original degraded image. In addition, this paper presents a fast Fourier transform-based structure loss for the enhancement task. With the new loss, our TIENet enables the structure image obtained to enhance more useful detection-favorable structural information and suppress irrelevant information. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on underwater (URPC2020) and foggy (RTTS) datasets show that our proposed framework can achieve 0.5–1.6% AP absolute improvements on classic detectors, including Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, ATSS, PAA, and TOOD. Besides, our method also generalizes well to the PASCAL VOC dataset, which can achieve 0.2–0.7% gains. We expect this study can draw more attention to high-level task-oriented degraded image enhancement.
